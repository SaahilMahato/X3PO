# X3PO
A personal voice assistant.\
version: 0.1.0

Hi, this is a personal voice assistant that I created for myself. The 
name is is inspired from a fictional character "C3PO" that exists in 
Star Wars which you would have known by now if you watch Star Wars. Since, 
it was created for me, it has the features that only I wanted
and operates according to my preferences. If you want to clone this repository
create your own assistant with X3PO as a base or modify it according to your preferences
feel free to do so as this is a public repository with MIT license.
